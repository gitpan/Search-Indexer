Search::Indexer - full-text indexer

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Search::Indexer;
  my $ix = new Search::Indexer(dir => $dir, writeMode => 1);
  foreach my $docId (keys %docs) {
    $ix->add($docId, $docs{$docId});
  }

  my $result = $ix->search('+word -excludedWord +"exact phrase"');
  my @docIds = keys @{$result->{scores}};
  my $killedWords = join ", ", @{$result->{killedWords}};
  print scalar(@docIds), " documents found\n", ;
  print "words $killedWords were ignored during the search\n" if $killedWords;
  foreach my $docId (@docIds) {
    my $score = $result->{scores}{$docId};
    my $excerpts = join "\n", $ix->excerpts($docs{$docId}, $result->{regex});
    print "DOCUMENT $docId, score $score:\n$excerpts\n\n";
  }

  my $result2 = $ix->search('word1 AND (word2 OR word3) AND NOT word4');

  $ix->remove($someDocId);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides support for indexing a collection of documents,
for searching the collection, and displaying the sorted results, 
together with contextual excerpts of the original document.

=head2 Documents

As far as this module is concerned, a I<document> is just a buffer of
plain text, together with a unique identifying number. The caller is
responsible for supplying unique numbers, and for converting the
original source (HTML, PDF, whatever) into plain text. Documents could
also contain more information (other fields like date, author, Dublin
Core, etc.), but this must be handled externally, in a database or any
other store. A candidate for storing metadata about documents
could be L<File::Tabular|File::Tabular>, which uses the same
query parser.

=head2 Search syntax

Searching requests may include plain terms, "exact phrases", 
'+' or '-' prefixes, boolean operators and parentheses.
See L<Search::QueryParser> for details.

=head2 Index files

The indexer uses three files in BerkeleyDB format : a) a mapping from
words to wordIds; b) a mapping from wordIds to lists of documents ; c)
a mapping from pairs (docId, wordId) to lists of positions within the
document. This third file holds detailed information and therefore is
quite big ; but it allows us to quickly retrieve "exact phrases"
(sequences of adjacent words) in the document.

=head2 Indexing steps

Indexing of a document buffer goes through the following
steps :

=over

=item *

terms are extracted, according to the I<wregex> regular expression

=item *

extracted terms are normalized or filtered out
by the I<wfilter> callback function. This function can for example
remove accented characters, perform lemmatization, suppress
irrelevant terms (such as numbers), etc.

=item *

normalized terms are eliminated if they belong to
the I<stopwords> list (list of common words to exclude from the index).

=item *

remaining terms are stored, together with the positions where they
occur in the document.

=back

=head2 Limits

All ids are stored as unsigned 32-bit integers; therefore there is 
a limit of 4294967295 to the number of documents or to the number of 
different words.

=head2 Related modules

A short comparison with other CPAN indexing modules is
given in the L</"SEE ALSO"> section.

This module depends on L<Search::QueryParser> for analyzing requests and 
on L<BerkeleyDB> for storing the indexes.

This module was designed together with L<File::Tabular>.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<new(arg1 =E<gt> expr1, ...)>

Creates an indexer (either for a new index, or for
accessing an existing index). Parameters are :

=over

=item dir

Directory for index files. and possibly for the stopwords file. 
Default is current directory

=item writeMode

Give a true value if you intend to write into the index.

=item wregex 

Regex for matching a word (C<qr/\w+/> by default).
Will affect both L<add> and L<search> method.
This regex should not contain any capturing parentheses
(use non-capturing parentheses C<< (?: ... ) >> instead).

=item wfilter

Ref to a callback sub that may normalize or eliminate a word.  Will
affect both L<add> and L<search> method.  The default wfilter
translates words in lower case and translates latin1 (iso-8859-1)
accented characters into plain characters.

=item stopwords

List of words that will be marked into the index as "words to exclude".
This should usually occur when creating a new index ; but nothing prevents
you to add other stopwords later. Since stopwords are stored in the
index, they need not be specified when opening an index for searches or 
updates.

The list may be supplied either as a ref to an array of scalars, or 
as a the name of a file containing the stopwords (full pathname
or filename relative to I<dir>).


=item fieldname

Will only affect the L<search> method.
Search queries are passed to a general parser
(see L<Search::QueryParser>). 
Then, before being applied to the present indexer module, 
queries are pruned of irrelevant items.
Query items are considered relevant if they have no
associated field name, or if the associated field name is
equal to this C<fieldname>.

=back

Below are some additional parameters that only affect the
L</excerpts> method.

=over

=item ctxtNumChars

Number of characters determining the size of contextual excerpts
return by the L</excerpts> method.
A I<contextual excerpt> is a part of the document text,
containg a matched word surrounded by I<ctxtNumChars> characters 
to the left and to the right. Default is 35.


=item maxExcerpts

Maximum number of contextual excerpts to retrieve per document.
Default is 5.

=item preMatch

String to insert in contextual excerpts before a matched word.
Default is C<"E<lt>bE<gt>">.

=item postMatch

String to insert in contextual excerpts after a matched word.
Default is C<"E<lt>/bE<gt>">.


=item positions

  my $indexer = new Search::Indexer(dir       => $dir, 
                                    writeMode => 1,
                                    positions => 0);

Truth value to tell whether or not, when creating a new index,
word positions should be stored. The default is true.

If you turn it off, index files will be much smaller, indexing
will be faster, but results will be less precise, 
because the indexer can no longer find "exact phrases". 
So if you type  C<"quick fox jumped">, the query will be 
translated into C<quick AND fox AND jumped>, and therefore
will retrieve documents in which those three words are present, but
not necessarily in order.

Another consequence of C<< positions => 0 >> is that
there will be no automatic check of uniqueness of ids
when adding documents into the index.

=item C<remove(docId [, buf])>

Removes a document from the index.

hash ref, where keys are docIds of matching documents, and values are
the corresponding computed scores.

=item killedWords

ref to an array of terms from the query string which were ignored
during the search (because they were filtered out or were stopwords)

=item regex

ref to a regular expression corresponding to all terms in the query
string. This will be useful if you later want to get contextual
excerpts from the found documents (see the L<excerpts> method).

=item C<excerpts(buf, regex)>

Searches C<buf> for occurrences of C<regex>, 
extracts the occurences together with some context
(a number of characters to the left and to the right),
and highlights the occurences. See parameters C<ctxtNumChars>,
C<maxExcerpts>, C<preMatch>, C<postMatch> of the L</new> method.

=head1 TO DO

=over

=item *

Find a proper formula for combining scores from several terms.
Current implementation is ridiculously simple-minded (just an addition).
Also study the literature to improve the scoring formula.

=item *

Handle concurrency through BerkeleyDB locks.

=item *

Maybe put all 3 index files as subDatabases in one single file.

=item *

Fine tuning of cachesize and other BerkeleyDB parameters.

=item *

Compare performances with other packages.

=item *

More functionalities : add NEAR operator and boost factors.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Search::FreeText> is nice and compact, but
limited in functionality (no +/- prefixes, no "exact phrase" search,
no parentheses).

L<Plucene> is a Perl port of the Java I<Lucene> search engine.
Plucene has probably every feature you will ever need, but requires
quite an investment to install and learn (more than 60 classes,
dependencies on lots of external modules). 
I haven't done any benchmarks yet to compare performance.

L<KinoSearch> is a more recent, more sophisticated search engine,
which looks very powerful and should be probably faster and definitely
more scalable than C<Search::Indexer>; but also with a less compact
API. I haven't performed any detailed comparison yet.
