Search-Indexer version 0.70
===========================

This module provides support for indexing a collection of documents,
for searching the collection, and displaying the sorted results, 
together with contextual excerpts of the original document.

As far as this module is concerned, a document is just a buffer of
plain text, together with a unique identifying number. The caller is
responsible for supplying unique numbers, and for converting the
original source (HTML, PDF, whatever) into plain text. Documents could
also contain more information (other fields like date, author, Dublin
Core, etc.), but this must be handled externally, in a database or any
other store; for example we built a document management system 
where metadata about documents is indexed through 
File::Tabular, and document content is indexed 
through this module.

The indexer uses three files in BerkeleyDB format : a) a mapping from
words to wordIds; b) a mapping from wordIds to lists of documents ; c)
a mapping from pairs (docId, wordId) to lists of positions within the
document. This third file holds detailed information and therefore is
quite big ; but it allows us to quickly retrieve "exact phrases"
(sequences of adjacent words) in the document.
